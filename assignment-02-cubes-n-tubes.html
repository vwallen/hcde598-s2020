                        <p>Before assembling the printer, I installed the "silent mainboard" upgrade. This required removing the default mainboard and swapping over all of the cables. I opted for the simplest route and swapped the cables one-by-one, rather than labelling all the cables individually and reassembling. This ended up with some tight contortions to get it all together, so I'd recommend labels and photos if I were to do it again. This took about an hour.</p>
                        <p>I assembled the printer using the instructions and <a hred="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q">this video</a>.</p>
                        <p>Assembling the printer took about 3 hours, at the end of which I realized the z-switch cable did not reach because I had routed it through the same outlet at the rest of the cables. I was able to partially disassemble the mainboard cover and re-route the cable through the dedicated z-switch slot, but this was not fun.</p>
                        <p>Then I assembled the enclosure and popped the printer in snug. One note about the Creality enclosure: it's designed with a side-panel to help access the extruder, and a nice grommet to pass the power cable through. Unfortunately, the enclosure is stitched together <i>backwards</i> so these touches don't help you at all. This isn't a one-off problem. as the photos on their site have the same issue.</p>
                        <p>If I had this to do again, I would not have bothered with the silent mainboard or the enclosure.</p>
